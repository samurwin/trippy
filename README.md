# Trippy - A Trip Planner Web App

Trippy is a trip planner web application. It utilizes the Google Maps API for location and map data. Built with Next.js and Typescript.

This project is still in development. There are many features I plan to add some will be listed below. The current version allows you to explore a location using search or by category such as attractions, restaurants and more.
